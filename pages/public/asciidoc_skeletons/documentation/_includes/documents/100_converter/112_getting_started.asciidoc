== Getting Started

You can get _Asciidoctor PDF_ by installing the published gem or running th
 code from source.

=== Install the Published Gem

_Asciidoctor PDF_ is published as a pre-release on RubyGems.org.
First, make sure you have satisfied the prerequisites.
Then, you can install the published gem using the following command:

 $ gem install asciidoctor-pdf --pre

If you want to syntax highlight source listings, you'll also want to install
Rouge, Pygments, or CodeRay. Choose one (or more) of the following:

.Rouge (preferred)
 $ gem install rouge

.Pygments
 $ gem install pygments.rb

.CodeRay
 $ gem install coderay

You then activate syntax highlighting for a given document by adding the
`source-highlighter` attribute to the document header (Rouge shown):

[source,asciidoc]
----
:source-highlighter: rouge
----

Assuming all the required gems install properly, verify you can run the
`asciidoctor-pdf` script:

 $ asciidoctor-pdf -v

If you see the version of _Asciidoctor PDF_ printed, you're ready to use
_Asciidoctor PDF_.

Let's grab an AsciiDoc document to distill and start putting _Asciidoctor PDF_
to use!

=== An Example AsciiDoc Document

If you don't already have an AsciiDoc document, you can use the
*basic_example.adoc* file found in the examples directory of this
project.

ifeval::[{safe-mode-level} < 20]
.000_basic_example.adoc
[source,asciidoc]
....
include::000_basic_example.asciidoc[]
....
endif::[]

It's time to convert the AsciiDoc document directly to PDF.

=== Convert AsciiDoc to PDF

IMPORTANT: You'll need the `rouge` gem installed to run this example since
it uses the `source-highlighter` attribute with the value of `rouge`.

Converting to PDF is a simple as running the `asciidoctor-pdf` script using
_Ruby_ and passing our AsciiDoc document as the first argument.

 $ asciidoctor-pdf 000_basic_example.adoc

This command is just a shorthand way of running:

 $ asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-pdf -b pdf 000_basic_example.adoc

The `asciidoctor-pdf` command just saves you from having to remember all those
flags. That's why we created it.

When the script completes, you should see the file *000_basic_example.pdf*
in the same directory. Open the *000_basic_example.pdf* file with a PDF
viewer to see the result.

ifdef::backend-html5[]
.Example PDF document rendered in a PDF viewer
image::/assets/images/pages/asciidoc_skeletons/example-pdf-screenshot.png[Screenshot of PDF document,width=800,scaledwidth=100%]
endif::[]

ifdef::backend-pdf[]
.Example PDF document rendered in a PDF viewer
image::/assets/images/pages/asciidoc_skeletons/example-pdf-screenshot.png[Screenshot of PDF document,width=800,scaledwidth=100%]
endif::[]

You're also encouraged to try converting the documents in the examples
directory to see more of what _Asciidoctor PDF_ can do.

The pain of the DocBook toolchain should be melting away about now.
