== Github Gist

Code snippets may helpful to support your readers for existing code examples.
An excellent place for code snippets is Gist at Github. To embed an existing
gist into your documents, the Asciidoc Extention *Gist block* provides the
block macro `gist::` to do so.

The following gist snippet is taken from {asciidoc-extensions-gist-example}[this example, window="_blank"]:

[source, prometheus, role="noclip"]
----
.Gist title
gist::git_address[] <1>
----
<1> For `git_address`, {github-gist-home}[, window="_blank"] is prepended automatically
