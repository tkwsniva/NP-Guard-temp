Welcome to the first preview page focussing on the image module. This page
shows some valuable features of the J1 Template to manage your image-based
content using lightboxes, carousels (slider), and galleries.

The image module offers complex functionality based on powerful OpenSource
libraries like JustifiedGallery for high-end, masonry-styled preview maps.
J1 Template uses the jQuery plugin Owl Carousel as a base for image sliders.
A carousel app (slider) lets you present your images as shows.

Lightboxes like LightGallery or Lightbox V2 support your web for enlarged
image views of your picture or video content. Have a look, a quick tour
of what J1 can do for image data. Have fun!

== J1 Lightboxes

A Lightbox is, in general, a helper which displays enlarged, almost
screen-filling versions of images (or videos) while dimming the remainder
of the page. The technique, introduced by Lightbox V2, gained widespread
popularity thanks to its simple style. The term lightbox has been employed
since then for Javascript libraries to support such functionality.

For the J1 Template, two different lightboxes are available:

* Lightbox V2 (lightbox)
* LightGallery

The default tool employed by J1 Template is Lightbox V2, a Javascript library
written by _Lokesh Dhakar_. The name of that (build-in) is *lightbox*.
For more complex use cases, like a thumbnail gallery preview or video support,
LightGallery can be used alternatively.

NOTE: The name LightGallery implies a sort of a Gallery, but the library is a
_lightbox_. And, LightGallery provides much more functionality on image-based
data rather than enlarged displaying of images. See the examples below to check
for the differences in comparison to the simpler Lightbox V2 lightbox.

Both lightboxes are fully integrated to be used as standalone modules or
used as helpers *under-the-hood* by other apps or modules focussing on
image-data like gallery or carousel, the build-in carousel module.

== Lightbox Examples

Find below an example of using the lightbox Lightbox standalone. See how
single (individual) images are linked for use with Lightbox.

.Lightbox block for standalone images
lightbox::example-standalone[ 400, {data-images-standalone} ]

Lightbox supports image groups (image sets). Click on the images below to
see how Lightbox manages a group of images.

.Lightbox block for grouped images
lightbox::example-group[ 400, {data-images-group}, group ]

=== LightGallery Example

LightGallery provides more complex functions on image data. The module
supports a gallery-style thumbnail preview plus image resizing, a download
dialog, sharing provider support, and more helpful. Check what
LightGallery can do this by the following example.

gallery::jg_old_times[]

== J1 Carousel App

J1 Carousel is based on OWL Carousel V1 in the latest (and unfortunately
last) version of 1.3.3. OWL Carousel is a clean and neat jQuery slider plugin
for creating fully responsive and touch-enabled carousel sliders.

NOTE: OWL Carousel V1 is no longer available on the Internet; for an
unknown reason. Anyway, the J1 Template is using this version of OWL
Carousel is a build-in carousel module because the software does an excellent
job, is based on an MIT license with no issues using them for private and
business use. And offers a lot of great features!

=== Simple Text Carousel

A slider or carousel is typically used for displaying images. Still, the
implementation for the J1 Template supports a lot more sources to be
displayed as a slide show: simple text, for example.

.Simple text carousel
carousel::demo_text_carousel[role="mb-3"]

Important statements or topics can be placed, e.g., on top of an article or
a paragraph, to give them better visibility. In one line, you can present
many facts to know animated for the reader's attention within a single
line. No much space is needed!

=== Parallax Text Carousel

A more eye-minded type of text-based slide show is a parallax text slider. If
you want to emphasize your statements focussing the meaning, this kind of a
slide show may be interesting. Image-based slide shows may draw off the
reader's attention from the text, therefore a pure text-based presentation
maybe the better choice.

.Parallax text carousel
carousel::demo_text_carousel_parallax[role="mb-3"]

Parallax text shows can be placed as banners on a page. For text shows,
different animations are available. Internally, J1 Template uses some of
the great CSS styles offered by _animate.css_.

TIP: Have a look a https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/[Dan Eden's home page]
to see all the possible dynamic styles you can create based on pure CSS. Some
of them are implemented for OWL Carousel for animation. See the documentation
for the CAROUSEL Module for more details.

=== Simple Image Carousel

Carousels are mostly used for pictures data to animate the images as a series.
Find with the following some examples of how to use a carousel for your image
data.

A simple image show is useful, for example, as an animated (or not animated)
banner presenting exciting things about your site or the products offered.

.Simple Image Carousel
carousel::demo_simple[role="mb-3"]

=== Carousel + Caption + Lightbox

Carousels are used for an exceptionally compact form of image galleries.
This example shows some pictures having individual caption text and supports
a lightbox to enlarge images full size. For the example below, an almost simple
lightbox is used: Lightbox V2; or short: lightbox.

.Nice cats
carousel::demo_cats[role="mb-3"]

The J1 module lightbox is a simple Lightbox but offers a bunch of impressive
features for displaying images. For example, the lightbox can display all
images (of a carousel) as a group. If one picture is opened in the lightbox,
others are browsed by easy-to-use control buttons.

=== One Slide Carousel + Lightbox

The build-in Carousel carousel supports multiple and single image shows.
Here you find an example of a single image slide show with controls enabled
to browse all images back and forth. An indicator below the slider shows how
many images the show contains.

.Single Slide Carousel and a Lightbox
carousel::demo_oneslide[role="mb-3"]

== JustifiedGallery

JustifiedGallery is a great jQuery plugin to create responsive, infinite,
and high-quality justified image galleries. J1 Template combines the Gallery
with the lightboxes supported to enlarge the images of a gallery.

See JustifiedGallery in action - and for sure, all that you see is even
responsive. Change the size of your current browser window, by width or height,
to see what will happen!

Pictures you've made are typically not even in size. Images may have the
same size (resolution), but some are orientated landscapes, or others
may be portraits. For that reason, a more powerful gallery is needed to create
so-called justified views.

JustifiedGallery uses a so-called masonry grid layout. It works by
placing elements in an optimal position based on available horizontal and
vertical space. Sort of like mason fitting stones in a wall. You'll have
seen it in use all over the Internet!

== What next

Hopefully, you've enjoyed exploring the possibilities J1 offers for managing
and displaying digital image content. But much, much more can the J1 do for
your web.
