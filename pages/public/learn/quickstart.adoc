The template comes with a Web included, a skeleton for new a website created
using J1 Template. This Web is called the *Starter web*, a general-purpose
scaffold to be modified for your needs. The built-in Starter web  is available
live at https://publish.jekyll.one/[J1 Publish, {browser-window--new}]. This
site show live pages deployed on the Internet on _Github_, _Netlify_
and _Heroku_.

A *Starter web* is created in minutes. This section

== The Software needed

J1 is supported on all current x64-based OS:

* Windows 10, build >= 1903
* Windows WSL 2
* Linux, kernel version >= 4.15 (e.g. Ubuntu  18.x LTS)
* OSX, version >= 10.10.5 (Yosemite)

WARNING: Note that 32-bit versions (x32) are generally NOT supported for all
platforms.

=== Development languages and tools

To run the Development System for J1 Template, the following languages and
tools expected to be in place with your OS:

* Ruby language, version >= 2.6
* Javascript language (NodeJS), version >= 12.x

NOTE: More current or older versions may work, but not tested.

=== Software upgrades needed for all platforms

If _Ruby_ and _NodeJS_ are in place, some packages needs to be upgraded to
more *current* versions. Install all packages system-wide with their
respective product installation paths.

==== Upgrades needed for Ruby < v2.7

Install latest bundler for Ruby:

[source, sh]
----
gem install bundler --no-document
----

Install latest RubyGems for Ruby:

[source, sh]
----
gem install rubygems-update --no-document
update_rubygems --no-document
gem update --system
----

==== Upgrades needed for NodeJS

NodeJS comes with NPM pre-installed. The native CLI for the NodeJS package
management is `npm`. Besides `npm` there's another quite handy CLI for NPM
available: *Yarn*.

The CLI `yarn` is developed at Facebook and can be used as a replacement
for `npm`. From a top-level perspective, both package management clients behave
pretty much the same. The syntax `yarn` uses is shorter in writing, making
the command-line look a bit more natural. Therefore, we prefer to use `yarn`.

NOTE: Yarn adds some additional features to the NodeJS package management
implemented for the needs at Facebook. Regarding the J1 development system,
those add-ons are neither needed nor used.

Install latest NPM and Yarn packages for NodeJS:

[source, sh]
----
npm install -g npm@latest
npm install -g yarn@latest
----

== Create a Starter Web

Running the J1 template project is very simple:

* Download the J1 Gem
* Create a J1 web project
* Setup the runtime environment for your project
* Run and develop the buildin starter web

Find all details on this with the sections below.

=== Download the J1 Gem

The Gem for J1 Template (runtime system) is published on _RubyGems_.
You can get it by installing the package using the Ruby `gem` command or
by downloading it from link:{url-j1--download}[RubyGems, {browser-window--new}].

.Userized installation
[source, sh]
----
gem install j1-template --remote --user-install --no-document
----

.System-wide installation
[source, sh]
----
gem install j1-template --remote --no-document
----

NOTE: To *not* pollute the system-wide Gem folder of a Ruby-installation by
*user* and *project* specific Gems, it is recommend to install *J1* userized.

J1 is a so-called *gem-based* template, a *Ruby Gem* managed by the (gem)
internal executeable (command) *j1*. Check your version installed or some
usage information by running:

.Version information
[source, sh]
----
j1 --version
----

.Usage information
[source, sh]
----
j1 --help
----

=== Setup a project

Is the Ruby Gem *J1* installed, a project, a website needs to be generated
by J1's build-in executable *j1*. The command *j1* is used to manage *base*
project tasks like generating a *project*.

If a *project* (a website) is generated, all development tasks are managed
by *NPM scripts* (NodeJS). Development *tasks* are defined as *scripts*
with the project config file `package.json`.

First, create a projects folder for all websites to be generated J1. For the
following examples, a project is generated on _Windows_ using *C:\Temp*
for the project's folder.

.Usage information
[source, sh]
----
j1 generate starter
----

.Output
----

----

=== Setup the runtime

The command *j1 generate* creates a project folder with the name given. In
this example, the project is *starter*. Change to this folder

[source, sh]
----
cd C:\Temp\starter
----

A J1 project consists in several files and folders. Find a typical structure
as below:

.J1 Project structure
----
  ├──── .
  │     └─ _data  <1>
  │     └─ _includes <2>
  │     └─ _plugins <3>
  │     └─ assets <4>
  │     └─ collections <5>
  │     └─ pages <6>
  │     └─ utilsrv
  ├──── _config.yml <7>
  ├──── config.ru
  ├──── dot.gitattributes
  ├──── dot.gitignore
  ├──── dot.nojekyll
  ├──── favicon.ico
  ├──── Gemfile <8>
  ├──── index.html <9>
  └──── package.json <10>
----
<1>   Configuration data for the website
<2>   Asciidoc (global) includes
<3>   Build-in (Ruby) plugins
<4>   Assets for the web
<5>   Folder that contains all blog posts
<6>   Folder that contains all (article) pages
<7>   Central (Jekyll) site configuration
<8>   Ruby Gemfile
<9>   Homepage for the web
<10>  (NPM) Project file

The first step, done only once, is to initialize a project. What means to
download and install all resources for your new website followed by an
initial creation process for the new site. Initializing a project is managed
by the (NPM) *task* `setup`. A bunch of sub-tasks gets fired, all of them
managed by NPM.

Let's start ...

[source, sh]
----
yarn setup
----

Because a lot of sub-tasks getting started for a (first) `setup`, see below
the output as a summary:

----
Setup project for first use ..
Bootstrap base modules ..
done.
Configure environment ..
done.
Create project folders ..
Create log folder ..
Create archived log folder ..
Create etc folder ..
done.
Bootstrap project modules ..
Bootstrap utility server modules ..
done.
Detect OS ..
OS detected: Windows_NT
Build site incremental ..
Configuration file: c:/Temp/starter/_config.yml
            Source: c:/Temp/starter
       Destination: c:/Temp/starter/_site
 Incremental build: enabled
      Generating...
    J1 QuickSearch: creating search index ...
    J1 QuickSearch: finished, index ready.
      J1 Paginator: autopages, disabled|not configured
      J1 Paginator: pagination enabled, start processing ...
      J1 Paginator: finished, processed 5 pagination page|s
                    done in 25.687 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: disabled. Use --watch to enable.
.. build finished.
To open the site, run: yarn site

Done in 88.03s.
----

The `setup` process will take a while. Typically some minutes for the *first*
run, depending on your Internet connection bandwidth and the workstation
performance. Many NPM modules and Ruby Gems are downloaded and linked for
the components part of the project. See `setup` as an extended *install* and
*build* process to manage your new website's initial setup.

=== Run and develop a starter web

Running the Starter Web for development is done like so:

[source, sh]
----
yarn site
----

The task `site` does a lot for you; whatever is necessary for a full-stack
Web development. The task will put in place all needed CSS and JS components,
build the Web content.

----
Startup the site ..
Configuration file: c:/Temp/starter/_config.yml
            Source: c:/Temp/starter
       Destination: c:/Temp/starter/_site
 Incremental build: enabled
      Generating...
    J1 QuickSearch: creating search index ...
    J1 QuickSearch: finished, index ready.
      J1 Paginator: autopages, disabled|not configured
      J1 Paginator: pagination enabled, start processing ...
      J1 Paginator: finished, processed 5 pagination page|s
                    done in 7.1 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '.'
LiveReload address: http://localhost:40001
    Server address: http://localhost:40000/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
        LiveReload: Browser connected
----

Finally, the starter web get openend in your *default* browser.

Go, go, go ..

=== Rebuild a site

A project runs Jekyll in *incremental* mode with *auto-regeneration* enabled.
All changes made to your web's pages and posts at runtime are automatically
detected, and the affected pages are rebuilt  and automatically reloaded with
your browser.

For rebuilding a *site* from scratch, a web can be completely rebuilt by
running the task `rebuild`:

[source, sh]
----
yarn rebuild
----

----
Rebuild site incremental ..
Clean up site files ..
Configuration file: c:/Temp/starter/_config.yml
           Cleaner: Removing _site...
           Cleaner: Removing ./.jekyll-metadata...
           Cleaner: Removing ./.jekyll-cache...
           Cleaner: Nothing to do for .sass-cache.
Configuration file: c:/Temp/starter/_config.yml
            Source: c:/Temp/starter
       Destination: c:/Temp/starter/_site
 Incremental build: enabled
      Generating...
    J1 QuickSearch: creating search index ...
    J1 QuickSearch: finished, index ready.
      J1 Paginator: autopages, disabled|not configured
      J1 Paginator: pagination enabled, start processing ...
      J1 Paginator: finished, processed 5 pagination page|s
                    done in 25.221 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: disabled. Use --watch to enable.
.. rebuild finished.
To open the site, run: yarn site.
Done in 34.88s.
----

If the site rebuild, re-run:

[source, sh]
----
yarn site
----

and continue developing your website.

=== Reset a project

To start from the beginning, you can reset the runtime system to the
factory state. The top-level task `reset` does the resetting work for you
and cleans up each and everything except the NPM modules folder `node_modules`
stored in the project root.

[source, sh]
----
yarn reset
----

The cleanup runs some tasks for the root folder and in parallel sub-tasks
using Jekyll for the Web:

----
Reset project to factory state ..
Clean up base modules ..
Clean up site files ..
Configuration file: c:/Temp/starter/_config.yml
           Cleaner: Removing _site...
           Cleaner: Removing ./.jekyll-metadata...
           Cleaner: Removing ./.jekyll-cache...
           Cleaner: Nothing to do for .sass-cache.
Clean up projects files ..
Remove bundle config folder ..
Remove log folder ..
Remove etc folder ..
Remove various log files ..
Remove lock files ..
Clean up utility server ..
done.
Done in 10.23s.
----

To reset the project *completely*, delete the folder `node_modules` manually
and start from the beginning by running the `setup` task again:

[source, sh]
----
yarn setup
----

If the project is newly setup, re-run:

[source, sh]
----
yarn site
----

and continue developing your website.

Happy Jekylling!
