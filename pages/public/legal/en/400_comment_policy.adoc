== Discuss with Respect

One of the most important aspects of a helpful blog is the conversation
that occurs through comments that visitors publish on blog posts. However,
comment conversations can sometimes take a negative turn or feature spam
links. That's why it's helpful to have this blog comment policy. Visitors
can understand what is and is not acceptable when commenting.

instances where comments will be edited or deleted. The owner of this site
reserves the right to edit or delete any comments submitted to the blog

Promotional::
Comments deemed to be spam or solely promotional in nature will be
deleted. Links to relevant content are permitted, but comments should be
relevant to the article topics.

Roughly language::
Comments containing language or concepts that could be deemed offensive
will be deleted. Note this may include abusive, threatening, pornographic,
