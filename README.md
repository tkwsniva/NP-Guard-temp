# J1 Development languages and tools

To run the project for J1 Template Web, the following languages and
tools expected to be in place with your OS:

*   Ruby language, version >= 2.6 < 3.x (v2.7.x recommended)
*   Javascript language (NodeJS), version >= 12.x < 14.x (v12.22.x recommended)

## Update the package managers for _NodeJS_

NodeJS comes with the package manager *NPM* pre-installed. The native CLI for
the NodeJS package management is `npm`. Besides `npm` there's another quite
handy CLI for NPM available: *Yarn*.

The CLI `yarn` is developed at _Facebook_ and can be used as a replacement
for `npm`. From a top-level perspective, both package management clients
behave pretty much the *same*. The syntax `yarn` uses is shorter in writing,
making the command-line look a bit more natural. Therefore, the use of
`yarn` is preferred over `npm`

Install the latest *NPM* and *Yarn* packages for _NodeJS_:

``` sh
npm install -g npm@latest <1>
npm install -g yarn@latest
```

* <1> The package managers *npm* and *yarn* are installed *globally* (-g)

# Setting up the project

Running the J1 template project is simple:

* Setup the project
* Bundle (install) all Ruby GEMs required
* Run and develop your web

* <3>   Build-in plugins (Ruby)
* <4>   Assets for the Web
* <5>   Folder that contains all Blog Posts

* <7>   Central site configuration (Jekyll)
* <8>   Ruby Gemfile
* <9>   Homepage for the Web
* <10>  J1 Project file (NPM)

## Bundle the Ruby GEMs

First, install (bundle) all Ruby GEMs required. You can install the
**bundle** with your home directory (userized):

``` sh
bundle config set --local path ~/.gem
bundle install
```

or system-wide:

``` sh
bundle install
```

## Initialize the project

Initializing the project is done by the NodeJS package manager *yarn*
running the task `setup`.

The task `setup` takes a while. Typically some minutes for the *first*
run (depending on the performances of your Internet connection and your
Desktop PC). A bunch of NPM modules and Ruby Gems gets downloaded, installed,
and linked for the project. See the setup task as an extended *install* and
*build* process to make your new website ready to use.

Let's start ...

``` sh
yarn setup
```

Because a lot of sub-tasks getting started for a (first) `setup`, see below
the output as a summary :

```
Setup project for first use ..
Bootstrap base modules ..
done.
Configure environment ..
done.
Create project folders ..
Create log folder ..
Create archived log folder ..
Create etc folder ..

                    done in 37.609 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: disabled. Use --watch to enable.
.. build finished.
To open the site, run: yarn site
Done in 94.94s.
```

## Running the Starter Web

Running the Starter Web for development is done like so:

``` sh
yarn site
```

The task `site` does a lot for you; whatever is necessary for a full-stack
Web development. The task will put in place all needed CSS and JS components,
build the Web content, and finally run the webite in a browser.

Go, go, go ..

```
yarn run v1.22.10
$ run-p -s site:*
Startup the site ..
UTILSRV disabled. Not started.
Configuration file: C:/J1Webs/starter/_config.yml   <1>
            Source: C:/J1Webs/starter   <2>
       Destination: C:/J1Webs/starter/_site   <3>
 Incremental build: enabled
      Generating...
    J1 QuickSearch: recreate index disabled.
      J1 Paginator: autopages, disabled|not configured
      J1 Paginator: pagination enabled, start processing ...
      J1 Paginator: finished, processed 1 pagination page|s
                    done in 9.618 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '.'
LiveReload address: http://localhost:40001    <5>
    Server address: http://localhost:40000/   <4>
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
        LiveReload: Browser connected   <6>
```

* <1> The configuration file for the builder engine _Jekyll_
* <2> The project folder
* <3> The *WebRoot* folder for your website creaated
* <4> The *URL* to access the web
* <5> A *LiveReloader* is started and listens on port *40001*
* <6> A webbrowser has been started automatically and the *LiveReloader*
    is connected

Your *default* web browser is automatically started, and the website gets
loaded.


## Reset the Project

To start from the beginning, you can reset the project to the factory state.
The top-level task `reset` does the resetting work for you
and cleans up each and everything except the Git repo and the NPM modules
folder `node_modules` stored in the project root. Both are kept untouched
by a reset.

``` sh
yarn reset
```

To reset the Development System *completely*, delete the folder `node_modules`
manually and start from scratch by running the `setup` task again:

``` sh
yarn setup
```

Happy Jekylling!
